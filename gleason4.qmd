## What is wrong with the Gleason score?

**The Gleason score was created in 1967 based on study of 6-month survival on a small number of patients.** It has not been importantly changed since.

**The Gleason score is based on the proportion of more versus less aggressive disease.** This is very unusual in cancer and leads to some counterintuitive results for individual patients.  

Below is a hypothetical example of two patients with a single positive core. The patient who has the core with the most pattern 4 and the most cancer overall is assigned grade group 2; the patient with the core with the least pattern 4 and the least cancer overall is assigned grade group 4.  
Blue: Normal tissue. Orange: pattern 3. Red: pattern 4.

Surgical pathology findings from two actual patients are given below. The patient assigned grade group 4 has 100-fold less cancer.Blue: Normal tissue. Orange: pattern 3. Red: pattern 4.

**Why has Gleason score stood the test of time as a predictor?** The Gleason score is correlated with the amount of pattern 4 disease. The figure below shows volume of pattern 4 in the radical prostatectomy specimens of men with different Gleason score.
