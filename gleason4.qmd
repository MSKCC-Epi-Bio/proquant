## What is wrong with the Gleason score?

**The Gleason score was created in 1967 based on study of 6-month survival on a small number of patients.** It has not been importantly changed since.

**The Gleason score is based on the proportion of more versus less aggressive disease.** This is very unusual in cancer and leads to some counterintuitive results for individual patients.  

 

**Schematic representation of examples of discordance between tumor quantification and Gleason scoring.** Blue: Normal tissue. Orange: pattern 3. Red: pattern 4.  

Hypothetical example of two patients with a single positive core. The patient who has the core with the most pattern 4 and the most cancer overall is assigned grade group 2; the patient with the core with the least pattern 4 and the least cancer overall is assigned grade group 4.

Biopsy cores from two actual patients with Grade group 2 being followed on active surveillance. The patient with a small increase in pattern 4 but a decrease in pattern 3 is upgraded to grade group 3; the patient with a large increase in both pattern 4 and overall cancer is not upgraded and remains at grade group 2.

The Gleason score is correlated with the amount of pattern 4 disease. This likely explains why it has stood the test of time as a predictor. The figure below shows volume of pattern 4 in the radical prostatectomy specimens of men with different Gleason score: light grey: 3+4; intermediate grey: 4_3; dark grey: 4+4.
